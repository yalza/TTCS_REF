MFPS comes with an Install wizard window that should be prompted automatically after you import the package,
if for any reason the install window did not appear or you accidentally close it you can open it again through the Unity editor navigation menu: MFPS -> Import.

Once the install window is shown simply follow the indications of the installer.

If you can't see the Unity Editor MFPS navigation menu most likely because you have some compilation errors, check the Editor console and fix the errors then the menu will appear.
